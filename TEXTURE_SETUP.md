## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. **Replace Placeholder Files**
You have beautiful planet images! Replace these placeholder files in the `textures/` folder:

```

├── mercury.jpg  ← Your cratered Mercury image (2nd image)  
├── venus.jpg    ← Your cloudy Venus image (3rd image)
├── earth.jpg    ← Your Earth image (when you have it)
├── mars.jpg     ← Your Mars image (when you have it)
├── jupiter.jpg  ← Your Jupiter image (when you have it)
├── saturn.jpg   ← Your Saturn image (when you have it)

```
